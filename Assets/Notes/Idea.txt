Remove the tree's and spider and change to color coded objects.

The players color won't matter, make it a grey orb or square

The obstacles will be a reddish hue

collectable will be green

The player's perception will be that it can detect color within a range

so as it starts playing the game, it will need to learn to 

    * not fall down
    * collect collectables (green)
    * avoid obstacles (red)

it wont know that obstacles (red) are bad, it will learn to avoid it through
a genetic algorithm using neural networks. same for collectables.
